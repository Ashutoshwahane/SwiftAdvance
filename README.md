# SwiftAdvance

**Loops** : for, while, repeat and infinite loop.

**Functions** : function with parameters, return type, with to keyword, underscore parameter, variadic function , throw and inout parameter

**Closures** : Swift lets us use functions just like any other type such as strings and integers. This means you can create a function and assign it to a variable,               call that function using that variable, and even pass that function into other functions as parameters.
